## 🛠 Technical Approach

### Data Preprocessing
- **Image Processing:** CFD snapshots are converted to 64×64 grayscale images
- **Normalization:** Drag force values are normalized using MinMax scaling
- **Data Splitting:** Dataset divided into 70% training, 10% validation, and 20% testing sets

### Modeling Pipeline
1. **Baseline Model:** Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) for initial drag force predictions.
2. **Optimized Model:**
   - **CNN:** Extracts spatial features from CFD snapshots.
   - **LSTM:** Captures temporal evolution of latent states from CNN outputs.
   - **Drag Prediction:** The combined CNN+LSTM pipeline outputs a single normalized drag value per input sample.
   - **Grid Search Hyperparameter Tuning:** An automated grid search (with K-fold cross-validation on the training set) is now applied to the CNN+LSTM pipeline. This tuning process optimizes key hyperparameters (e.g., learning rates, epochs, batch sizes, latent dimension, and LSTM hidden size) to reduce overfitting and improve model generalization.
   - **Shape Matching Fixes:** Training and evaluation routines have been updated to ensure that the LSTM’s scalar output and the target tensor have matching dimensions, eliminating broadcasting warnings.

### Updated Training & Evaluation Instructions
- **Training:**  
  Run `main.py` to split the dataset into a training set and a holdout test set, perform grid search for the CNN+LSTM pipeline, train the final models using the tuned hyperparameters, and save the models.
  ```bash
  python main.py
  python evaluate.py
