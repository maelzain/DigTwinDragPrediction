# Digital Twin for 2D Unsteady Flow Drag Prediction

## Overview
This project introduces an advanced machine learning framework that integrates traditional Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) with deep learning methods to predict instantaneous drag forces on a sphere in 2D unsteady flow fields. The solution dramatically reduces simulation time and computational costs, enabling real-time analysis and design optimization.

## Technical Approach

### Data Preprocessing
- **Image Processing**: CFD snapshots are converted to 64×64 grayscale images
- **Normalization**: Drag force values are normalized using MinMax scaling
- **Data Splitting**: Dataset divided into 70% training, 10% validation, and 20% testing sets

### Modeling Pipeline
1. **Baseline Model**: Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) for initial drag force predictions
2. **Optimized Model**:
   - **CNN**: Extracts spatial features from CFD snapshots
   - **LSTM**: Captures temporal evolution of latent states from CNN outputs
   - **Drag Prediction**: The combined CNN+LSTM pipeline outputs a single normalized drag value per input sample
   - **Grid Search Hyperparameter Tuning**: Automated grid search with K-fold cross-validation optimizes key hyperparameters to reduce overfitting and improve model generalization
   - **Shape Matching Fixes**: Updated training and evaluation routines ensure matching dimensions between LSTM's scalar output and target tensor

### Training & Evaluation Instructions
- **Training**:  
  Run `main.py` to split the dataset, perform grid search for the CNN+LSTM pipeline, train the final models, and save the models.
  ```bash
  python main.py
  python evaluate.py
  ```
