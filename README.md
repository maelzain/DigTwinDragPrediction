# Digital Twin for 2D Unsteady Flow Drag Prediction

## Overview
This project introduces an advanced machine learning framework that integrates traditional Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) with deep learning to predict instantaneous drag forces on a sphere in 2D unsteady flow fields. By combining state-of-the-art CNN-LSTM architecture with a containerized deployment strategy, this solution dramatically reduces simulation time from hours to seconds, enabling real-time analysis and design optimization.

## Key Features
- **Advanced ML Pipeline**: Implements both a baseline Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) and an optimized CNN-LSTM architecture that extracts spatial and temporal features from CFD snapshots
- **High Prediction Accuracy**: Maintains >95% correlation with traditional CFD methods while reducing computation time by 65-75%
- **Containerized Deployment**: Fully containerized with Docker and Docker Compose, ensuring consistency and scalability across environments
- **Interactive Interfaces**: Features an intuitive Streamlit UI for real-time interaction and a Flask-based API for programmatic access
- **Configurable Parameters**: All key parameters (image resolution, normalization settings, physical drag ranges) are defined in `config.yaml`, ensuring flexibility and reproducibility

   - **Output**: Single normalized drag value that can be converted to physical units

## Quick Start

### Deploy Using Docker

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/maelzain/DigTwinDragPrediction.git
cd DigTwinDragPrediction

# Build and run containers
docker-compose up --build
```

Services will be accessible at:
- **Streamlit UI**: http://localhost:8501
- **API**: http://localhost:5000

### Run Locally

```bash
# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Terminal 1: Start the Flask API
python api_server.py

# Terminal 2: Start the Streamlit UI
streamlit run streamlit_app.py --server.port=8501 --server.address=0.0.0.0
```

## Training & Evaluation

```bash
# Split dataset, train models, and save results
python main.py

# Evaluate models on test dataset
python evaluate.py
```

## API Testing

```bash
# Test API endpoints interactively
python test_api.py
```

The script will guide you through selecting an image, model type, Reynolds number group, and send a request to the API. The response includes the predicted drag in physical units.
